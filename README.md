# Workshop RHEL for the Edge

This workshop is based in [https://github.com/RedHatGov/RFESummit2021](https://github.com/RedHatGov/RFESummit2021).

This workshop is an introductory workshop to show how to use RHEL **Image Builder** feature to build, deploy and manage RHEL for Edge deployments.

> ![IMPORTANT](icons/important-icon.png) This workshop has been tested using Fedora 35 as hypervisor and ansible controller node.

> ![IMPORTANT](icons/important-icon.png) All the playbooks should run with no problems on Fedora 35, RHEL 8 and CentOS Stream 8. Maybe some minor changes will have to be done for repositories if CentOS Stream 8 is used. The key words here are **should** and **maybe**. Remember that your definition of **minor** maybe it is not the same that mine :-P.
